                    <p class="lead">1. Internal Finance Reconciliation Tool<br><br>
                    In need of a new process to automate and manage their team finances efficiently, the Information Delivery Team presented me with the opportunity to document and design a more efficient process to replace the current one. I organized meetings with the team's Data Sourcing and Operations Manager to create an extensive Business Requirements Document for the new tool, which outlined all test cases, requirements, and implementation details. The tool will be automated using Microsoft SQL Server and used by the Information Delivery team upon completion.

                    2. SharePoint Collaboration Website<br><br>
                    The Data Management Team was seeking a new SharePoint collaboration website, as their current website was outdated, unorganized, and not user-friendly. I utilized Microsoft’s .NET Framework, HTML, CSS, Microsoft Visio, and SharePoint Designer to fully redesign, rebuild, and ultimately optimize the SharePoint website. In the process, I worked with another intern to organize and lead meetings with 15+ Vice Presidents of the Data Management team to document their website requirements and present updates. Currently, my site serves as the team's official website and is used for all communications, document storage, team info, key resources, etc.

                    3. Flood Insurance QA Project<br><br>
                    Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to modify tables/views and write queries for the Flood QA Project using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Additionally, I performed Business-As-Usual changes for the Information Delivery Team, which involved creating tables in SQL.

                    4. Read Charlotte Web Development Volunteer<br><br>
                    In my spare time, I took the initiative to learn more about the city's non-profit "Read Charlotte" organization, a program dedicated to improving the reading level of 3rd grade students in Mecklenburg County. I attended meetings with the leaders of the organization and helped edit their website as they worked to rebrand the organization.

                    <p class="lead">As the only Indiana student selected to attend Chicago's “Girls Do Hack” event, I gained hands-on experience by collaborating with other students and working with mentors in STEM careers. Sponsored by Teza Technologies and partnering organizations, activities reflected a cross-section of STEM careers and included mobile app development, electrical engineering, prototyping and designing buildings, game design, and 3D printing. I was selected to return in 2014 to lead the mobile app development workshop, and again in 2015 as a volunteer and mentor. New activities added range from robot obstacle courses to making chocolate to conducting biotech experiments.</p>
